        <h1>Welcome!!!</h1>    
            <p>Rui has a Ph.D. in Civil and Environmental Engineering from Utah State University and an M.S. in Hydraulic and Civil Engineering from Xinjiang Agricultural University.<p> 
            <p>Rui specializes in hydrology, water resources, remote sensing, and data science. Ruiâ€™s research focuses on water use estimation via physical- and non-physical-based approaches at different spatial scales. Rui is currently more focused on crop water status and stress estimation using physical- and data-driven-based approaches based on high-resolution UAV images at the field scale (e.g., California vineyards). Rui is also active in professional service as a reviewer for journals like Remote Sensing of Environment and Agricultural Water Management. He is passionate about developing innovative solutions for precise, sustainable, systemic agricultural water management.</p>
